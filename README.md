# Introduction to Modern Application Development 2017 conducted by NPTEL    

This repository was forked from the main hasura repo. It contains the required files I used during the course of IMAD 2017. 

IMAD 2017 is India's largest MOOC conducted by MNPTEL and supported by IIT Madras, Google and NASSCOM


It contains all my HTML , CSS and JS content I built during the course. As I learn more I will keep updating the repository too.
